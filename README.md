# Gumroad Dashboard Actions Tab Demo

This project is a demo for the Gumroad Design Engineer position, showcasing a proposed "Actions" tab on the Gumroad dashboard. The goal of this feature is to help users quickly gain insights from their data and take actions that can lead to increased sales. By highlighting opportunities based on user data, this feature enables sellers to make better use of existing capabilities such as checkout discounts, workflow automation, and email campaigns with just one click.

## Key Features

1. **Purpose**: This demo addresses the challenge users face in understanding and acting upon their analytics. The "Actions" tab is designed to provide quick insights and actionable steps to help users optimize their sales strategies on Gumroad.

2. **Actions Tab**: The "Actions" tab helps users identify opportunities in their data and offers one-click solutions, such as creating discounts, setting up email campaigns, and automating workflows. This allows users to act quickly and effectively, improving their chances of making sales.

3. **Site Structure**: This demo recreates the Gumroad site to showcase the "Actions" tab and a few supporting click-through pages. All other pages are either dead links or redirect to an "About" page.

4. **Data Source**: The data used to inform these pages is structured in the same format as the Gumroad Sales Export CSV. This allows the feature to analyze real sales data and provide relevant suggestions to the user.

5. **Scalability**: As users engage with the feature and provide feedback, Gumroad can expand the use cases of the "Actions" tab. This could include analyzing different types of data, identifying more scenarios for user actions, and enabling A/B testing based on past performance. Additional support from a data scientist could be leveraged as the feature matures.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling is handled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.

## Usage

This demo showcases a proposed enhancement to the Gumroad dashboard. It focuses on improving user experience by providing actionable insights directly within the dashboard. The "Actions" tab and related features are built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements based on user feedback and data analysis.
